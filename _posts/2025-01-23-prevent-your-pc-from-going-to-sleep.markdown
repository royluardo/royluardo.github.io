<h2>Prevent your PC from going to sleep</h2>

<p>Yes, Windows can be configured to prevent it from going to sleep mode or having the screen turned off. But, if your school or work set up your computer to do just that, there is no way to change it without administrative rights.</p>

<p>however, you can actually prevent your PC from entering sleep mode by constantly jiggling your mouse.</p>

<p>To do that automatically, here is a script (in exe format) that you can run to jiggle your mouse every minute interval.</p>

{% assign version =  "now" | date: "%Y%m%d%H%M"  %}
<p>Download <a href="{{'/download/NoSleep1m.zip?v=0X' | append: version | relative_url }}" target="_blank">this</a>.

<p>Save this exe file to your startup folder and run it.</p>
