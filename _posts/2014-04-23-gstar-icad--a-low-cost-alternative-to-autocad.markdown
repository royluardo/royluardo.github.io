<h2>GStarICAD is the innovative alternative to AutoCAD</h2>

<p><strong>GStarICAD</strong> is based on the well-known IntelliCAD software which is the industry standard for low-cost CAD software. GStarICAD is the innovative alternative to AutoCAD that provides OpenDWG file compatibility, similar environment, as well as full support for AutoCAD commands, menus, scripts, styles, patterns etc. GStarICAD is the top quality version of IntelliCAD worldwide, 99% identical to AutoCAD and its speeds and performances with an attractive and competitive price are totally unbeatable.</p>

That means you can get to work immediately using the AutoCAD files, commands and applications you rely on.</p>
